# ToqiNet-CNN
ToqiNet-CNN is a library for image recognition and processing. ToqiNet-CNN is inspired from AlexNet. This model is still very much work on progress. ToqiNet-CNN model offers simplicity and support for custom dataset and features which implies to autoresize and image size handling while training image.
I am still working on the documentation. If you would like to contribute please give a message to my <a href="https://web.facebook.com/tahmeedtoqi777/">account</a>.
